# AWS-NIST-Audit
AWS Cloud Security Audit &amp; Risk Assessment: A hands-on analysis of 600+ controls using Prowler, mapped to the NIST CSF 2.0 framework for enterprise risk remediation.
AWS Cloud Security & Compliance Audit (NIST CSF 2.0)📌 Project OverviewThis project involved a comprehensive security assessment of an AWS environment using Prowler, an open-source security tool. The goal was to identify technical misconfigurations and map them to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 to provide a clear risk profile and remediation roadmap.🛠️ Tools & TechnologiesCloud Provider: AWS (IAM, S3, CloudTrail, EC2)Security Scanner: Prowler (CLI-based)Compliance Framework: NIST CSF 2.0Data Analysis: Google Sheets (Advanced Formatting & Logic)📊 MethodologyDiscovery: Ran an automated scan using Prowler to capture the current state of 600+ security controls.Risk Categorization: Prioritized findings into Critical, High, Medium, and Low based on their potential impact on data confidentiality and account integrity.Mapping: Aligned technical "FAILS" to specific NIST CSF 2.0 subcategories (e.g., PR.AC: Identity Management and Access Control).Remediation Planning: Developed step-by-step technical solutions for the highest-risk items.🚨 Critical Findings & ImpactFindingSeverityRisk ImpactNIST CSF CategoryRoot MFA DisabledCRITICALPotential total account takeover; no "break-glass" protection.PR.AA-01Public S3 BucketsCRITICALDirect exposure of sensitive data to the public internet.PR.DS-01CloudTrail DisabledHIGH"Blind spots" in audit logs; inability to perform incident response.ID.RA-01🛠️ Sample Remediation StepsRoot Account Security: Enforced Virtual MFA for the root user and created dedicated IAM administrative roles to minimize root login frequency.S3 Guardrails: Implemented S3 Block Public Access at the account level to serve as a global security control against human error.
